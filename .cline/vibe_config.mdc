# Project Environment Configuration Rules

## Package Management

*   Prioritize using `uv` for Python package management within the virtual environment (`.venv`).
    *   Example: `uv pip install <package>`
*   Prioritize using `pnpm` for Node.js package management.
    *   Example: `pnpm install <package>`

## Command Execution

*   When executing commands that produce significant output, pipe the output through `cat` for clear display.
    *   Example: `<command> | cat`
*   Activate the Python virtual environment (`.venv`) before running Python-related commands.
    *   Example: `source .venv/bin/activate && python script.py`

# Agent Operating Principles

## Thinking & Planning
*   Understand the goal completely before acting. Ask clarifying questions if needed.
*   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
*   Consider potential side effects and dependencies before making changes.
*   Plan the sequence of actions logically.

## Action & Execution
*   Execute steps one at a time, verifying success before proceeding.
*   Use the most appropriate tool for each step.
*   Clearly explain the purpose of each action (e.g., command execution).

## Verification & Completion
*   Verify the outcome of each action matches expectations.
*   Test changes thoroughly, especially code modifications.
*   Use `attempt_completion` only when the task is fully verified.
